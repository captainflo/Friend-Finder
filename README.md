# Friend-Finder

In this activity, I builded a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I use Express to handle routing. I deployed my app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.

### Hosting on Heroku

Now that I have a backend to my applications, I use Heroku for hosting.
